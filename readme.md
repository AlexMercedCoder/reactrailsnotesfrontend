# SIMPLE REACT TEMPLATE

#### Created by Alex Merced of AlexMercedCoder.com/devNursery.com

This is a minimalistic webpack react build. Best for practicing react, doesn't have many of the testing and post-processing features other builds have. Although you can add webpack and babel plugins as you wish if you want to use this as a starting place for a more powerful build setup.

Make sure to remove the git repository

`sudo rm -r .git` from the root folder

Otherwise...

`npm run dev` to run dev server
`npm run build` to build into build folder

- sass is enabled, so feel free to use sass files
